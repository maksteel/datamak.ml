introduction: |

  Hi! I'm a data scientist with hands-on experience in predictive/ prescriptive analytics of big complex datasets using Python, R, and SQL, on large-scale data processing and computing platforms such as [NeSIâ€™s High Performance Computing (HPC)](https://www.nesi.org.nz/services/high-performance-computing) or Azure Databricks.
  
  I'm pioneering AI-assisted operational, strategic and clinical decision support systems in healthcare sector. In particular, creating ethical machine learning models that are highly interpretable and at the same time have great predictive performance.

  Additionally, I train and mentor individuals and corporate cohorts of [Data Science Master program, remotely](https://greyatom.com/programs/data-science-online-course). This program has a unique blend of online learning and face-2-face interactions (via video conferencing).
  
  This site contains my talks/ projects related to data science, data analysis, machine learning, general linux hacks and so on. Posts can be viewed from the navigation menu on the left side. 

  If you are working on something interesting or just want to say Hello, then I can be reached through email or social media (click the icons above).
