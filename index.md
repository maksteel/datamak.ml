introduction: |

  Hi! I'm a data scientist/ machine learning engineer with hands-on experience in predictive/ prescriptive analytics of big complex datasets using Java, Python, R, Matlab and SQL, on large-scale data processing and computing platforms such as [NeSIâ€™s High Performance Computing (HPC)](https://www.nesi.org.nz/services/high-performance-computing).
  
  I'm very passionate about employing artificial intelligence (AI) in data analysis. In particular,  creating machine learning models that are highly interpretable and at the same time have great predictive performance.
  
  This site contains my blogs/ projects related to data analysis, machine learning, general linux hacks and so on. Posts can be viewed from the navigation menu on the left side. 

  If you are working on something interesting or just want to say Hello, then I can be reached through email or social media (click the icons above).
